# 🗿 3D Animations

This project depicts a little girl sitting at a desk and reading, and includes an animation of turning the pages of the book with her right hand and making small curls with her hair with her left hand (twisting a strand around her finger).

For the environment, we modeled elements such as a bookshelf, a desk, a chair, a bed on which a cat sits, a pen, a vase, a flower, a lamp etc.

🖼️ Here you can see the **images** of the models after which the modelings were made in Blender: [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KrtfnI6g9WFwshSkZCHlGv8jc4hR68jy?usp=sharing).
