# 🗿 3D Animations

This project depicts a little girl sitting at a desk and reading, and includes an animation of turning the pages of the book with her right hand and making small curls with her hair with her left hand (twisting a strand around her finger).

🖼️ For the environment, we modeled elements such as a room, a bookshelf, a cabinet, a desk, a chair, a book, a plant, a vase, a sofa, a lamp, a ghost and the Earth globe.
