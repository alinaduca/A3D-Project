# 🗿 3D Animations

👻 This project depicts a haunted room and includes several animations, including one for turning the pages of the book, one for the ghost trail, one for the door and knob, one for the globe, and one for the lamp.

🖼️ For the environment, we modeled elements such as a room, a bookshelf, a cabinet, a desk, a chair, a book, a plant, a vase, a sofa, a lamp, a ghost and the Earth globe.
